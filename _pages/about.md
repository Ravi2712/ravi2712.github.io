I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the [iDRAMA Lab](http://idrama.science) under the guidance of [Dr. Jeremy Blackburn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_ApnIUAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [State University of New York, Binghamton](https://www.binghamton.edu/). I have a master's degree focused on AI-related research projects from [Auburn University](auburn.edu/), Alabama. My industrial experience includes working as an iOS Software Engineer for 3+ years. Besides having three college degrees in Computer Science, I love teaching and mentoring people.

Research Interests
======
Misinformation, Computational Social Science, Network Science, Machine Learning

*	I work on **understanding memes and videos** that disseminate misinformation through multimodal fusion techniques. 
*	My research interest lies in studying large-scale data from social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan by applying **Statistical methods** and **Computer vision**. 
*	Another direction in my research is detecting hidden coordinated groups from social media platforms using **Graph-algorithms** in an **unsupervised** fashion.

<!-- During master's degree at Auburn University, I gained knowledge on **developing AI agents** using Evolutionary algorithms that evolves human-interpreted strategies through Genetic programming. -->
