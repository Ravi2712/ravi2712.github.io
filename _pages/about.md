I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [iDRAMA Lab](http://idrama.science) under the guidance of [Dr. Jeremy Blackburn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_ApnIUAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [State University of New York, Binghamton](https://www.binghamton.edu/). I have a master's degree focused on AI-related research projects from [Auburn University](auburn.edu/), Alabama. My industrial experience includes working as an iOS Software Engineer for 3+ years. Besides having three college degrees in Computer Science, I love teaching and mentoring.

Computational Social Science, AI (NLP), Network Science

*	My research interest involves studying large-scale data from social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan by applying **Statistical methods**, **NLP techniques (e.g., LLM)** and **Computer vision**.
* My most recent research focuses on developing an automated social media content moderation system using open-source **Llama 3.1 (LLM) models**.
* I also work on understanding memes and videos that propagate misinformation using **multimodal fusion techniques**.
<!-- *	Another direction in my research is detecting coordinated groups from social media platforms using **Graph-algorithms (Social Networks)** in an **unsupervised** fashion. -->
<!-- During master's degree at Auburn University, I gained knowledge on **developing AI agents** using Evolutionary algorithms that evolves human-interpreted strategies through Genetic programming. -->
