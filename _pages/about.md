I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the [iDRAMA Lab](http://idrama.science) at the State University of New York, Binghamton. I have a master's degree focused on AI-related research projects from Auburn University, Alabama. My industrial experience includes working as an iOS Software Engineer. Besides having three college degrees in Computer Science, I love teaching and mentoring people.

Research Interests
======
I work on **understanding memes and videos** that disseminate misinformation through multimodal fusion techniques. My research interest lies in applying **Machine learning, Computer vision, and Statistical methods** to textual and multimedia data collected from social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan for characterizing unseen patterns. The second direction in my research is developing **Graph-algorithms** to detect hidden coordinated groups from social media platforms.

During master's degree at Auburn University, I gained knowledge on **developing AI agents** using Evolutionary algorithms that evolves human-interpreted strategies through Genetic programming.
